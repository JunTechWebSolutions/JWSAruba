		"@type": "Question",
		"name": "Will JWS Aruba maintain our website for us?",
		"acceptedAnswer": {
			"@type": "Answer",
			"text": "Yes, JWS Aruba can maintain your website on a per-occurrence basis or monthly. A good website will grow over time. When a website is launched (or relaunched), the work doesn’t end. And one thing we’ve seen plenty of are websites that go live but are then neglected in terms of ongoing maintenance. You must ensure that your website is properly maintained. Websites that contain broken links or outdated content are particularly frustrating to users."

		"@type": "Question",

		"acceptedAnswer": {
			"@type": "Answer",
			"text": "JWS Aruba does not directly offer domain and web hosting services. However, I can provide my years of experience to help you choose the best domain and website hosting solution for your business website. We’ll suggest a web host and domain registrar if you don’t have one and work with you to set it up."

		"name": "What does SEO stand for?",
		"acceptedAnswer": {
			"@type": "Answer",
			"text": "Search Engine Optimization is all about getting your website higher up in the search results on search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yandex. The higher you rank in the results, the more traffic (and customers) you are likely to receive. There are many aspects that go into achieving good SEO, and one of the most important is the copy (words) on your website. Focus on well-written, keyword-rich, and appropriate content is the key."

		{
		"@type": "Question",
		"name": "How long does SEO take?",
		"acceptedAnswer": {
			"@type": "Answer",
			"text": "The answer to this question depends on the context of the question—whether you mean how long it takes to see results or how many hours it takes to optimize a website. If you mean how long it takes to see results from an SEO campaign, then the answer is that nobody knows. Search engines crawl websites at their own rate. It could take a day or a few months to achieve positive results. There is no way of knowing when your website will be &quotcrawled,&quot because it is a random process.  If you are asking how long it takes, that depends on the project and the type of website. Initial setup, in our experience, takes much longer than regular SEO maintenance; typically between 5 and 10 hours, depending on the website and what is done. Sites with a lot of content and dynamic urls may take up to three times as long. After the initial setup, it usually takes between 2 and 4 hours per week to perform SEO."
